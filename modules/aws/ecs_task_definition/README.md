# ECS Task Definition Module

This Terraform module creates an Amazon ECS Task Definition, including IAM roles, a CloudWatch Log Group, and support for multiple containers with flexible configuration.

## Resources Created

- ECS Task Definition (`aws_ecs_task_definition`);
- IAM Roles:
  - Task Execution Role (with permissions to pull images and send logs);
  - Task Role (for runtime container permissions);
- IAM Policies (basic permissions for S3, CloudWatch, SSM);
- CloudWatch Log Group;

## Usage

```hcl
module "nginx_task_definition" {
  source = "./ecs_task_definition"

  name   = "nginx"
  region = "us-east-1"

  cpu    = "256"
  memory = "512"

  container_definitions = [
    {
      name      = "nginx"
      image     = "nginx:latest"
      cpu       = 256
      memory    = 512
      essential = true
      log_driver = "awslogs"
      environment = []
      port_mappings = [
        {
          container_port = 80
          host_port      = 80
          protocol       = "tcp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Project = "demo"
  }
}
```
